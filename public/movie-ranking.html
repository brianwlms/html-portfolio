<h1>BDubs Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>One of the greatest movies of a reluctant hero that inspires a nation to overcome overwhelming odds.</p>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>This movie uses time to disorient the viewer to both emphasize the protagonist's struggle, and creates a sense of tension to unfold the story.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A profound story of accepting your circumstance, but not falling victim to it.<br> The hero overcomes his wrongful conviction and makes small progress to freedom. In a world where everyone around him accepts their fate, Andy never gives up hope and continues to push towards freedom.</p>
